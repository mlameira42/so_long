In this project we, 42 students, are asked to make a 2D looking game, with a camera from above the player and simple moviments.
The wall hitboxes are also required.

We start from a simple map with the exentension ".ber" being required for the program to read the map. Which, itself, is simply a group of 1 and 0.
The map has to be closed by 1 and have a 'P', 'C' and 'E' characters that stand for "Player", "Coin" and "Exit" respectively.

Here is an exemple of a map that is acceptable:

The keys to move are, normally, "AWSD" or the arrow keys.
Our job as students is to make a game from that map, starting from parsing it to learn more about the minilibx library all the way to make the visualization and gameplay of the project.
This project teaches us, more than anything else, to inovate with the tools given to us and to learn new technologies by ourselfs.
Here is a printscren of the game I made.
